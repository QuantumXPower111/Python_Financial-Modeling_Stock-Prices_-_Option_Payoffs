# **Python Financial Modeling: Stock Prices & Option Payoffs**

## **📌 Project Overview**
This repository contains materials for **Lesson 1: Project-Based Python Financial Modeling**, designed for high school Computer Science students (grades 10–12). Students will learn to apply Python programming concepts to model basic financial scenarios, including variable assignment, data types, and vector operations using NumPy arrays.

---

## **🎯 Learning Objectives**
- Apply Python programming concepts to model financial scenarios
- Use variable assignment and data types (e.g., floats) for financial values
- Perform vectorized calculations using NumPy arrays
- Model uncertain stock prices and option payoffs programmatically
- Present and explain code logic in a collaborative setting

---

## **📚 TEKS Standards Addressed**
